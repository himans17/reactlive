                    <h3>Ketu Pooja</h3>
                    <p>
                      Ketu Puja is celebrated with great enthusiasm all over
                      India and particularly in West Bengal. It marks the
                      victory of Goddess Ketu over the demon king Mahishasura.
                      The festival signifies the triumph of good over evil,
                      light over darkness, and the power of the divine to
                      protect the world.
